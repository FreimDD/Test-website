                <p class="text-09">Once upon a time, in a forest,
                    all the trees started speaking different languages. Oaks spoke English,
                    birches spoke French, and pines spoke Spanish.
                    This left all the animals bewildered until a wise old eagle taught them how to understand the "tree
                    language,"
                    which all the animals could comprehend. From then on, they communicated seamlessly,
                    and even the trees in the forest learned English!</p>

            <p class="text-2">In an ancient forest, there was a tree that could summon rain when it was sad and sunshine
                when it was happy.
            <p>
            <p class="text-2">
                One day, when the entire forest was in despair due to drought,
                this tree began to play cheerful tunes, and the sun shone once more.
                Thus, it became the beloved of all the animals in the forest.</p>
